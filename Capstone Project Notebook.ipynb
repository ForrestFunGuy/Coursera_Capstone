I would like to follow the idea provided by instructor to compare multiple aspects of two big cities, New York and Toronto by using their demographic data as I am a big fan of travel. I have lived in Toronto for 5 years and have mixed feellings about it. I also travelled to New York once and fell in love with it within 5 days. I would say this idea really attracts my attention because it could help me understand more deeply about these two cities, including their neighborhoods, their communities, venues, infrastructures and so on. This project aims to answer the question that what makes a city unique by providing a clearer picture about all above aspects, and this project is for all travel-lovers, urbanologists, and anyone who lives in or is interested in these two cities. Hopefully I will find something interesting.
