We will mainly use Toronto geographical data and New York geographical data with Foursquare location data in this project. The data here are actually given by this course, which include toronto geographical coordinates of each postal code http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data, toronto neighborhood data https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, , New York neighborhood data  https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset. As all data are available throughout this project, it would save a lot of time searching for data and import them. Again, this is just my preliminary brainstorming about data. I will for sure integrate Foursquare location data into this project and I will specify all necessary data sources if I use them later in this project.
